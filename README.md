# Naive-Hasse
Programs to visualize the Naive Algorithm and Hasse's Theorem created for senior capstone project.

Naive-Hasse.R contains the acutal code to create a table for the number of points for an elliptic curve over a finite field and a graph to visualize Hasse's Theorem.

App.R creates a shiny app for this code to be easily interacted with.

Text.Rmd gives some context to be shown on the app.

Needed packages:
  "tidyverse"
  "numbers"
  "shiny"
  "markdown"
  "DT"
